# What is Advanced Analytics?

Advanced analytics is the process of using complex machine learning (ML) and visualization techniques to derive data insights beyond traditional business intelligence. It enables organizations to:

- Analyze vast volumes of data
- Discover hidden patterns and trends
- Improve business process efficiency and customer satisfaction
- Make future and real-time decisions
- Derive meaning from unstructured data (e.g. social media comments, images)
- Solve complex problems more efficiently

Advancements in cloud computing and data storage have made advanced analytics more affordable and accessible to all organizations.
